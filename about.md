Hi ðŸ‘‹

My name is Fernando Bunn, Iâ€™ve started to develop apps for phones as a hobby since 2006 with (the glorious ðŸ˜‚) J2ME. Iâ€™ve dedicated my career to iOS development since 2008 when Interface Builder was separated from Xcode (with those majestic floating windows ðŸ™ƒ) and iOS was called iPhone OS.

Since then Iâ€™ve contributed to the development of the first Salesforce iPad app, developed apps like the first version of the Maxim/Outside magazine for the iPad, [StoryDesk](https://vimeo.com/109495626) which was a native presentation iPad app later acquired by Showpad, and founded a mobile design and development studio. After that I launched and supported the [MyTime Scheduler for Merchants app](https://mytime.com/m-scheduling) at [MyTime](https://mytime.com/) and I'm currently at [DuckDuckGo](https://duckduckgo.com) ðŸ¦†

My goal with this site is to write (hopefully ðŸ˜…) interesting things about iOS development (or anything else I feel like it)
